# Lean Logger

## What is Lean Logger?

Lean Logger is a web/mobile application for people who want to track their workouts and
food, and that's all.

## Is Lean Logger for me?

It depends. Here's why:

We're aware there's a plethora of other apps that track your food and workouts; we've
used our fair share. We find that for us, they are bloated with unnecessary
features that distract you from your true goals and end up being too complicated to
use that it becomes a chore.

We don't offer you complicated sugar, salt & macro-nutrient tracking by
scanning the barcodes of your cucumbers and pickles. We're not offering you workout
plans that'll get you ripped in 3 hours. None of that!

What we offer is simple - an easy way to log your workouts and your food so you can
your own records and hold your self accountable.

Had Grannys Spaghetti Bolognese last night? Just add it! Nobody else will ever see it,
it's your own little library of food. Did you do 20 reps of the "scary machine by the
air conditioning unit"? That makes sense to you, it's not harming anyone else, add it!
